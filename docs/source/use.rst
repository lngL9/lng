The “Data-Browser” page adopts an interactive, alphanumeric-sorted table format. The browser table displays Sample ID, Known Spot/Domain Type, Technology, Tissue, PMID, Disease status, Species, Sample Name, and Spot Number, Annotation strategy from Original Article, Spot/Domain. Users can quickly search samples and customize filter criteria through “Species”, “Technology”, “Tissue”, “Disease Status”, “Spot/Domain”, “SpatialQC score” and “Known Spot Type”. Users can use the dropdown menu at the bottom of the table to change the number of entries displayed per page.
