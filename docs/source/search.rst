3.2.Search
------------------
We design three search models, including Search by Spot/Domain Type , Search by Technology and Search by Disease Status.

3.2.1 Search by SpotType
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the Search by Spot Type mode, users can determine the scope of sample queries by specifying the species and spot/domain type, thus obtaining results of interest.
